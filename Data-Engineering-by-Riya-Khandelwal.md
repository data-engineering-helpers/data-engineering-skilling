### Terms
* Data Pipeline - An automated set of processes that moves data from various sources (think databases, APIs, logs) to destinations such as data warehouses or lakes.
* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
  * Extract data from diverse sources
  * Transform (clean, enrich, or reshape) for consistency
  * Load into analytical systems for reporting or ML
* Data Lake - A central repository designed to store raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data at scale. Ideal for big data, advanced analytics, and machine learning use cases.
* Data Warehouse - Optimized for storing structured, organized data—think rows and columns. 
* Data Governance - A framework of policies and standards to ensure data is accurate, secure, compliant, and used responsibly. 
* Data Quality - A measure of data’s accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability. 
* Data Cleansing - The process of detecting and correcting errors and inconsistencies in datasets. 
* Data Modeling - Structuring and organizing data into logical formats—schemas, tables, relationships.
* Data Integration - Combining data from multiple sources—databases, files, SaaS apps—into a unified view for analysis or operational use.
* Data Orchestration - Automating, scheduling, and managing complex workflows across multiple data pipelines, tools, and platforms.
* Data Transformation - Converting data from its raw form into a format suitable for analysis or integration, such as normalizing values, aggregating, or encoding.
* Real-Time Processing - Analyzing and acting on data as it’s generated, enabling immediate insights and responses—vital for use cases like fraud detection and IoT.
* Batch Processing - Processing large volumes of data in predefined chunks or intervals, rather than continuously. Suitable for reporting, analytics, and data refreshes.
* Cloud Data Platform - Leveraging cloud-based solutions for scalable, flexible, and cost-effective data storage, processing, and analytics
* Data Sharding - Breaking a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces (shards), each running on a separate server to improve performance and scalability.
* Data Partitioning - Dividing datasets into segments or partitions (e.g., by date, region) to speed up query performance and enable parallel processing.
* Data Source - The origin point of your raw data—could be APIs, files, databases, sensors, or external platforms.
* Data Schema - A blueprint that defines how data is organized—what fields exist, their types, and relationships—crucial for consistency and validation.
* DWA (Data Warehouse Automation) - Tools and technologies that automate the design, deployment, and management of data warehouses—reducing manual effort and time-to-value.
* Metadata - Data about data—providing essential context like data types, definitions, lineage, and relationships.
