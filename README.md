# Overview
[This project](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/data-engineering-skilling)
aims at collecting in a single place training resources for the up skilling
of data engineers.

Even though the members of the GitHub organization may be employed by
some companies, they speak on their personal behalf and do not represent
these companies.

### Topics
* Data Pipeline - An automated set of processes that moves data from various sources (think databases, APIs, logs) to destinations such as data warehouses or lakes.
* ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
  * Extract data from diverse sources
  * Transform (clean, enrich, or reshape) for consistency
  * Load into analytical systems for reporting or ML
* Data Lake - A central repository designed to store raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data at scale. Ideal for big data, advanced analytics, and machine learning use cases.
* Data Warehouse - Optimized for storing structured, organized data—think rows and columns. 
* Data Governance - A framework of policies and standards to ensure data is accurate, secure, compliant, and used responsibly. 
* Data Quality - A measure of data’s accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability. 
* Data Cleansing - The process of detecting and correcting errors and inconsistencies in datasets. 
* Data Modeling - Structuring and organizing data into logical formats—schemas, tables, relationships.
* Data Integration - Combining data from multiple sources—databases, files, SaaS apps—into a unified view for analysis or operational use.
* Data Orchestration - Automating, scheduling, and managing complex workflows across multiple data pipelines, tools, and platforms.
* Data Transformation - Converting data from its raw form into a format suitable for analysis or integration, such as normalizing values, aggregating, or encoding.
* Real-Time Processing - Analyzing and acting on data as it’s generated, enabling immediate insights and responses—vital for use cases like fraud detection and IoT.
* Batch Processing - Processing large volumes of data in predefined chunks or intervals, rather than continuously. Suitable for reporting, analytics, and data refreshes.
* Cloud Data Platform - Leveraging cloud-based solutions for scalable, flexible, and cost-effective data storage, processing, and analytics
* Data Sharding - Breaking a large database into smaller, more manageable pieces (shards), each running on a separate server to improve performance and scalability.
* Data Partitioning - Dividing datasets into segments or partitions (e.g., by date, region) to speed up query performance and enable parallel processing.
* Data Source - The origin point of your raw data—could be APIs, files, databases, sensors, or external platforms.
* Data Schema - A blueprint that defines how data is organized—what fields exist, their types, and relationships—crucial for consistency and validation.
* DWA (Data Warehouse Automation) - Tools and technologies that automate the design, deployment, and management of data warehouses—reducing manual effort and time-to-value.
* Metadata - Data about data—providing essential context like data types, definitions, lineage, and relationships.
